# PID-Control-Beam-Balance
Uses PID Control Theory and the Arduino Uno Microcontroller to position a ball on a target position on a beam balance. Beam balance is controlled by a servo motor on a joint. 

Processing is used to connect the Arduino Uno to graph the error. 

The graph code is in BeamBalanceControl and must be run in a processing ide.
The regular code is in BalancePID which must be run in an Arduino ide.
The folder labeled BeamBalance is the first iteration of my code that did not work out because of sensor inaccuracies and lack of control.

Here are control vids for the project.
