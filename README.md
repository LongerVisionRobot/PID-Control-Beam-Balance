# PID-Control-Beam-Balance
Uses PID Control Theory and the Arduino Uno Microcontroller to position a ball on a target position on a beam balance. Beam balance is controlled by a servo motor on a joint. 

Processing is used to connect the Arduino Uno to graph the error. 

Here are control vids for the project.
